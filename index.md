My name is Alex Miller and I'm in my last year of studying Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz. I'm currently doing research with the [LINQS](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/) lab run by Professor Lise Getoor. I'm interested in machine learning methods that leverage the relational structure of data and methods that can incorporate diverse sources of information. You can find my CV [here](https://almumill.github.io/Alex%20Miller%20CV.pdf).
