My name is Alex Miller and I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC Santa Cruz. I'm working with the [LINQS](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/) lab run by Professor Lise Getoor. I'm interested in machine learning methods that leverage the relational structure of data and methods that can incorporate diverse sources of information. You can find my CV [here](https://almumill.github.io/Alex%20Miller%20CV.pdf).

I'm currently taking Algorithms (CSE 201) and Machine Learning (CSE 242) here.
